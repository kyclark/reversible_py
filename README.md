# Find Reversible Words

Can figure out what these words have in common?

* Banana
* Dresser
* Grammar
* Potato
* Revive
* Uneven
* Assess

No, it is not that they all have at least 2 double letters.

In all of the words listed, if you take the first letter, place it at the end of the word, and then spell the word backwards, it will be the same word.
